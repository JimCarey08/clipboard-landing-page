## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) CSS FrameWork


### What I learned

I put on practice bootstrap grid and propreties in general, learned that mobile-firts is a lot easier to deal with and that was my first junior level project of front-end mentor :)


### Continued development

definitively i need to improve the combining of bootstrap and css custom to get betters results, so learn about specificity...
